  ## Description

  This Project was created using Node.js and the Inquirer package for a user to create an HTML file with a company's team and their profiles listed on it. Once the app is run in Node, the user is prompted with multiple questions that will generate an HTML file for the user. It contains profile information for the Manager, Engineers, and Interns. They all include information about their ID, email, and their name. The Manager employee has an office number, the Engineer has a github link, and the interns have their school.

  ## Installation

  Install the index.js file, the utils folder, and the package.json folder to your computer. To use this application, the user must have Node.js and the Inquirer package installed. Once the user has these installed, they can open the terminal and type "node index" and the user will be prompted with multiple quesitons before the README file is generated.
  
  ## Usage

  When the user runs the file, they are asked questions about the Manager's office number, then the mangers name, email, and office number. Once they answer these questions they are asked if they would like to add another employee. If they choose yes, they can add an Engineer or an Intern. Then they are prompted with multiple questions to populate their profiles.
